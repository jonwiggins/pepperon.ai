# [pepperon.ai](https://pepperon.ai)

pepperon.ai is an open-source Python toolset for machine learning and data science and is distributed under the MIT License (Please don't sue me).

This project was started in 2019 by @JonWiggins as a central repository for some of the fun algorithms from various courses at the University of Utah. 

It is intended to be a lot like scikit-learn, except more buggy, with less functionality, worse documentation, and not used by anyone. But that's okay, because making it will be fun.

## Motivation
pepperon.ai is built on a few core ideas:

1. Machine Learning should be accessable to the masses
2. Bugs should be more common in software packages
3. Runtime, much like digging holes, builds character

## Version
pepperon.ai is currently on version 0.12.0

## Installation

### Requirements
pepperon.ai requires:
- Python (>= 3.5)
- NumPy (>= 1.11.0)
- A lot of Patience
- Scipy (>= 0.11)
- Pandas (>= 0.24)

### User Installation
You can install pepperonai from pypi via:

`pip install pepperonai`

# Modules
## Supervised Learning
### Decision Trees
- Decision Trees created with ID3 ; for all your decison needs
### Perceptron
- Simple Perceptron ; for all your needs that are both linearly seperable and basic
- Average Perceptron ; for all your needs that are both linearly seperable and noisy
### SVM
- SVM on SGD ; for when you are using Perceptron, and decide you want it to be better
### Niave Bayes
- Guassian and Bernoulli
### Random Forest
- Random Forest on ID3
### KNN
- Labeling data based on it's nearest neighbors 
### Linear Regression
- For line based modeling
## Language
### Ngrams
- ngrams ; for all your simplistic corpus needs 
### Kgrams
- kgrams ; for all your shingling needs
## Data
### Misa Gries
- For creating a heavy hitters lower bound
### Count Min Sketch
- For creating a heavy hitters upper bound
### Utils
- *In progress*
- Fowlkes-Mallows Index ; for comparing clusterings;
- Purity Index ; for comparing clusterings
- Grid Search for finding the best hyperparameters for your model
- Jackknifing to create cross validation folds
- General testing and evaluating methods
## Unsupervised Learning
### kmeans++
Clusters based on the kmeans++ algorithm, all based on probability
### Gonzales
Clusters based on the Greedy Gonlzales algorithm, iteratively picks the furthest point from the existing clusters to be a new center.
### Heirarchical Clustering
Rather than basing off of clusters, Heirarchial methods iteratively merge the two nearest clusters. What defines *near* is based on the linking method given, the built in linking functions provided are:
- Single link: finds the smallest distance between two points in clusters
- Complete link: find the largest distance between two points in clusters
- Mean link: finds the average distance between two points in clusters
- Various distance and similarity functions

## Usage Examples
Maybe one day I will make some files that show off how to go about using these systems

## To do
- Add examples usage files
